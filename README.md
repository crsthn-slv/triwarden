> **Status:** early releases (0.x). It works with real Vaultwarden and Bitwarden accounts and is tested against both,
> but keep your usual client around until 1.0. Screenshots show the built-in demo vault, not a real account.

## Install

Requires macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later.

```bash
brew install --cask sinhong2011/tap/triwarden
```

Or download the signed, notarized DMG from the [latest release](https://github.com/sinhong2011/triwarden/releases/latest).
Triwarden can check for signed updates in **Settings › About**. Automatic checks and installation are opt-in.
Homebrew users can update with `brew upgrade --cask triwarden`.

## Start here

1. Open Triwarden and choose your Vaultwarden server, Bitwarden US or Bitwarden EU. Sign in with your existing account.
2. Enable Triwarden in **System Settings › General › AutoFill & Passwords** to fill passwords, passkeys and verification codes.
3. Use **⌘F** to filter the vault list, or **⇧⌘Space** to open the command palette, in Triwarden or any other app.
   Auto-type needs Accessibility permission for **Triwarden Auto-Type**; configure it in **Settings › Shortcuts**.
   The browser extension is optional; its integration controls are in Settings.

**Offline:** you can unlock and read the encrypted vault saved on this Mac. Creating, editing, importing and deleting
items require a connection to the account's server; changes are not queued for later.

**Official builds and payment:** personal use can continue without a paid key, with all features available and no time limit.
After about 30 days, an unregistered official build may show a purchase reminder at launch, at most once a week.
A one-time paid key removes the reminder and covers one person on all their Macs. Using an official build with work
accounts requires one paid key per person. See [paid license terms](docs/LICENSE-TERMS.md). Source builds retain the GPL rights described below.

## Features

**Your vault, natively**
- Logins, secure notes, cards, identities and SSH keys, with folders, favorites, custom fields, Archive and Trash;
  password history, clone, and "ask for master password" on sensitive items. Add, rename, replace, download and remove attachments in the item editor.
- Several accounts at once, across servers: self-hosted Vaultwarden or Bitwarden, and Bitwarden cloud (US and EU).
  Password, two-step and single sign-on (SSO) login are supported.
- Shared vaults (Bitwarden organizations) and their shared folders (collections): a Vaults section (My vault and
  each shared vault; ⌘-click to see several together), shared folders nested like your own, move items into a shared vault, change shared folders, event logs for admins; live
  sync over WebSocket.
- Pick many items (⌘-click, ⇧-click, ⌘A) to move, archive, trash or restore them at once.
- Item history: when it was created and last edited, when its password changed, and its earlier passwords.
- Works offline from the encrypted cache; edits go straight to the server.
- Future item types remain visible and read-only, with their encrypted data preserved. Writes and exports
  that cannot safely handle them stop with an explanation.

**Fast to reach**
- One search over every vault (⌘F), with filters that stay on between launches: type, folder, vault, favorites,
  one-time code, passkey and Watchtower issue. Pick them from the filter menu or type them — `type:card`, `has:otp`,
  `#Work` — with suggestions as you type; ⌫ takes the last one off. See [Search](docs/search.md).
- Every shortcut on one page: Help › Keyboard Shortcuts (⌃⇧/).
- A command palette from anywhere (⇧⌘Space in any app, Triwarden included, or a shortcut you choose) to find any item or run any
  command. Called over a browser or an app, it puts that page's (or app's) logins first, and ↵ types the username
  and password in, like KeePass auto-type (⌃↵ username, ⌥↵ password, ⇧ also submits). The menu bar panel shows the
  page's logins too.
- Global shortcuts you set in Settings › Shortcuts: the palette, fill the page or app you're in (⌥⌘\\ types its
  only login), show the window, copy a new password, lock. Menu shortcuts change in System Settings like any app's.
- A menu bar panel with the item you need, one-time codes and the generator.
- Create a login from the active browser tab to prefill its name and website.
- Two-finger swipes between sidebar, list and item on narrow windows.

**Deep macOS integration**
- System AutoFill for passwords, **passkeys** and one-time codes, in Safari, Chrome and apps; equivalent domains
  (a google.com login fills on youtube.com).
- Touch ID or PIN unlock, one touch for every account; a lock timeout per account, and log out instead of lock if you
  prefer.
- Copied secrets clear themselves from the clipboard, with a countdown in the window's footer.
- An SSH agent backed by your vault's SSH keys (sign git commits too).
- A browser extension for Safari, Chrome, Edge, Brave and Firefox that fills and saves logins with approval in the app.
  Passkey sign-in uses macOS System AutoFill; it is not yet handled by the browser extension.
- App Intents and Shortcuts; a `tw` command-line tool; and an option to hide Triwarden from screenshots, recordings and screen sharing.

**Security tools**
- Watchtower: weak, reused, breached and unsecured (http://) passwords, and sites that offer two-step login you
  haven't set up (k-anonymity for breaches; nothing leaves in the clear). The list marks each item's issue, and
  "Change on Site" opens the site's own change-password page.
- Account security: fingerprint phrase, two-step login (authenticator app, email, recovery code), change the master
  password or KDF, devices, sign out everywhere, and approve sign-ins from your other devices.
- Emergency access: trusted contacts who can view or take over your vault after a wait you choose.
- A generator for passwords, passphrases (EFF wordlist) and usernames, with history.
- Send: share text or files with an encrypted link; edit it later and keep the same link.
- Self-hosted-server support for private certificate authorities and extra request headers such as Cloudflare Access tokens.
- Import from Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass, KeePass, Proton Pass, Dashlane, Apple Passwords, Chrome and Firefox;
  export in Bitwarden's formats, including password-protected JSON.

The optional full vault-door animation is enabled in **Settings › General**. You type the master password at its hub; each character lights one of the
pins' runes and turns the rings (the tumbler carries the twelve signs of the zodiac). Each of the three rings has a
notch. On unlock they turn, outside in, until the notches line up into one keyway and light runs down it to the hub;
only then does the door take itself apart, and the screen parts like a vault's inner gate:

## Build from source

Requirements: macOS 26, Xcode 26, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), Node.js and pnpm.

```bash
brew install xcodegen node pnpm
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinhong2011/triwarden.git
cd triwarden
make run        # generate the project, build and open the app
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make` | List all commands |
| `make test` | Unit tests for the crypto, API, import/export and SSH agent (`Packages/VaultCore`) |
| `make test-dev` | Integration tests against the disposable Vaultwarden environments on the configured remote Docker host |
| `make selftest` | End-to-end app self-test against that remote development environment (`DevServer/`) |
| `make selftest-compatibility` | Offline synthetic checks for future item types, cache reopen and mutation protection |
| `make selftest-secrets` | Signed-app Keychain and local API-key profile checks using isolated test data |
| `make uitest` | Click-through UI tests on a demo vault (quit any running copy first) |
| `make snapshots` | Light and dark renders of every screen into `build/snapshots` (`ONLY=login,send` for just those) |

Core logic lives in the `Packages/VaultCore` Swift package: `TriCrypto` (KDFs, EncString, keys, TOTP,
generators, passkeys), `VaultwardenAPI` (login, 2FA, SSO, sync, edits, attachments, Send, import/export),
`SSHAgent` (SSH approvals and browser native messaging), and `SecretsAgent` (approved local tool launches).
The app is in `App/`, the AutoFill extension in `AutoFill/`, browser extensions in `BrowserExtension/`.

## Command line

For vault lookups, turn on **Settings > Developer > Answer the tw command**.
Open **Terminal Helper Setup…** on that page (or **Triwarden › Install Terminal Helper…**) and choose **Copy & Open Terminal**.
Paste the command, enter your Mac password, and the sheet notices when `tw` is installed. **Show command** shows exactly what runs.

`tw status`, `tw get github | pbcopy`, `tw code github`, `tw list mail`, `tw generate --length 32`, `tw lock`.
Reading from the vault asks for Touch ID in the app.

Local API-key tools are optional developer features. New users start with these pages hidden.
Enable **Settings > Developer > Show Secrets**, then open **Secrets**.
Start with **Import from an .env file**, **Use a key already in the vault**, or **Walk me through it**.
The guide covers key storage, tool setup, helper installation, first approval, and repeat use.
It includes a dummy-key exercise that needs no provider account or API charges.

Use the copied launch command or its `tw-` alias to start the saved tool. Once remains the default approval.
While a tool has temporary access, a status at the top of the screen can show the time left and let you end it.
Use `tw run` to choose a saved tool in Terminal and `tw tools list` to see its exact launch commands.
Each API-key item shows which tools use it; **Access › Permissions** and **Access › History** show active grants and previous decisions.
The program receives the selected keys and can retain or transmit them.
Start with [Getting started](docs/local-api-keys-getting-started.md).
See the [Terminal guide](docs/local-secrets-dx.md) for commands and [Local API credentials](docs/local-secrets.md) for security limits.

## Security

Your master password and decrypted vault keys never leave the Mac; the server only ever sees encrypted vault data.
Touch ID protects a local encrypted copy of the vault key with a Secure Enclave key, while refresh tokens and custom
server headers live in the Keychain. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the details, the threat model, and how
to report a vulnerability privately.

## Accessibility and languages

The app provides VoiceOver labels, keyboard shortcuts, Increase Contrast and Reduce Motion support.
Validation limits and remaining gaps are documented in
[ACCESSIBILITY.md](ACCESSIBILITY.md). The app speaks English, 繁體中文, 粵語, 简体中文, 日本語, 한국어, Français, Español and ไทย.
